Overview
The TypeScript-Starter is a strict development kit built to enforce high standards from day one. It combines TypeScript’s strict type system with a curated set of tools that promote clean code, fast feedback, and thorough verification. The project is designed for teams that value predictability, readability, and robust APIs. It emphasizes a consistent coding style, strict type checks, actionable feedback from tooling, and automated documentation generation. The goal is to minimize friction when adding features while maximizing long-term maintainability.

What makes this starter useful
- Strong typing from top to bottom. The configuration emphasizes explicit types and safe defaults.
- A unified toolchain. ESLint, Prettier, Jest, TypeDoc, and TypeScript work together with sensible defaults and clear rules.
- Reliable quality gates. Automated linting, formatting checks, tests, and type checks run as part of local workflows and CI.
- Clear structure. The repository layout encourages modular code, easy testing, and straightforward navigation.
- Good developer experience. Quick start commands, helpful scripts, and concise documentation speed up onboarding.

Why use this starter
- You want consistent code across a team. The enforced rules reduce bike-shedding around style and contracts.
- You need to catch type issues early. The strict TypeScript config helps surface problems during development, not after release.
- You value reliable tooling. End-to-end checks ensure that code remains clean, documented, and testable as it evolves.
- You plan to scale. A legible architecture, clear conventions, and solid docs reduce technical debt when teams grow.

Core principles
- Clarity over cleverness. Code should read like a clear contract, not a mystery.
- Safety first. Type safety and careful defaults prevent many runtime errors.
- Consistency everywhere. A single rule set reduces cognitive load and review time.
- Fast feedback loops. Local checks help developers stay in the green and catch issues early.
- Documentation as a first-class concern. Public APIs and modules are documented as they are implemented.

Tooling at a glance
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled to enforce rigorous typing.
- ESLint with TypeScript support for static analysis and style enforcement.
- Prettier for consistent formatting that respects project conventions.
- Jest for fast, deterministic tests with good TypeScript support.
- TypeDoc for generating readable API documentation directly from code.
- Type-aware test utilities and helpers to simplify testing patterns.
- A clean, extensible project structure that supports growth.

Getting started
Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or newer (LTS recommended).
- npm 9.x or newer, or an alternative like pnpm or yarn if you prefer.
- A modern shell capable of running common commands.

- Build readiness check
  - npm run build:check
  - This validates TypeScript compilation and ensures the project boots in a minimal environment.

If you want a faster start
- You can also create a new project that follows this starter’s conventions by copying the skeleton into a new location. The setup is designed to be portable across teams and projects, with minimal friction to begin contributing.

Configuration snapshots
tsconfig
- A strict setup that enforces explicit types and minimizes permissive behavior.
- Key options:
  - "strict": true
  - "noImplicitAny": true
  - "noImplicitThis": true
  - "alwaysStrict": true
  - "module": "ESNext"
  - "target": "ES2020" or higher
  - "moduleResolution": "node"
  - "esModuleInterop": true
  - "skipLibCheck": true
  - "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
- Includes all source files in src and excludes node_modules and dist.

ESLint
- A TypeScript-aware linting configuration that integrates with Prettier.
- Core ESLint plugins:
  - @typescript-eslint
  - eslint-plugin-prettier
- Extends:
  - eslint:recommended
  - plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended
  - plugin:prettier/recommended
- Sample rules:
  - @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type: error
  - no-unused-vars: off (handled by TS)
  - prettier/prettier: error
- Parser:
  - @typescript-eslint/parser
- Settings note: turn on project references for monorepos if needed.

Prettier
- Formatting rules designed to pair with ESLint.
- Typical settings:
  - semi: true
  - singleQuote: true
  - trailingComma: "all"
  - printWidth: 100
  - tabWidth: 2
  - arrowParens: "always" or "avoid" as chosen by project policy
- Ensure a consistent code style across all languages in the repo.

Jest
- Testing configuration focuses on small, deterministic tests and TypeScript support.
- Config highlights:
  - preset: "ts-jest"
  - testEnvironment: "node"
  - transform: { "^.+\\.(t|j)sx?$": "ts-jest" }
  - testPathIgnorePatterns: ["/node_modules/", "/dist/"]
  - clearMocks: true
- Test organization:
  - Unit tests under tests/unit
  - Integration tests under tests/integration
- Test coverage strategy:
  - Coverage thresholds to enforce minimum quality
  - Branch coverage where appropriate for critical code
- Useful test helpers:
  - test-utils for common mocks and utilities

TypeDoc
- Generates friendly API documentation from source.
- Typical options:
  - entryPoints: ["src/index.ts"]
  - out: "docs"
  - tsconfig: "tsconfig.json"
  - includeDeclarations: false
- Documentation strategy:
  - Document public APIs clearly
  - Provide examples and usage notes in doc comments
  - Keep types up to date with code

CI and release workflows
- Continuous integration
  - Lint, format check, type-check, and unit tests run on pull requests
  - Node.js matrix for major versions to catch regressions
- Release automation
  - Tag-based triggers create a release page and publish artifacts if configured
  - Documentation generation triggered as part of release
- Example workflow features
  - Caching for dependencies
  - Parallel test execution
  - Fail-fast behavior for critical checks

How to customize and extend
- Changing rules
  - Update .eslintrc, .prettierrc, and tsconfig to suit the project
  - Add or modify TypeScript rules with @typescript-eslint
- Extending tooling
  - Add more tests under tests/unit and tests/integration
  - Introduce integration tests with environment-dependent scenarios
  - Expand TypeDoc usage with more entry points
- Supporting multiple packages
  - For monorepo setups, consider a workspace strategy, shared configs, and package-level scripts
- Adopting new standards
  - If your team adopts newer TypeScript features or linting patterns, integrate gradually with deprecation notes

Usage examples and patterns
- A minimal TypeScript module pattern
  - A small, pure module with explicit exports
  - Clear function signatures and documented behavior
- Common utils
  - Robust utilities for handling nullish data
  - Consistent error handling and messaging
